            prevent the attack from accessing application containers. Cloud Foundry

        narative:
          c: "- HM9000 is essential to ensuring that apps running on Cloud Foundry\
            \ remain available. HM9000 restarts applications whenever the DEA running\
            \ an app shuts down for any reason, when Warden kills the app because\
            \ it violated a quota, or when the application process exits with a non-zero\
            \ exit code\n- Cloud Foundry application monitoring component HM9000 (Health\
            \ Manager) has four core responsibilities:\n- Monitor applications to\
            \ determine their state (e.g. running, stopped, crashed, etc.), version,\
            \ and number of instances. HM9000 updates the actual state of an application\
            \ based on heartbeats and droplet.exited messages issued by the DEA running\
            \ the application.\n- Determine applications\u2019 expected state, version,\
            \ and number of instances. HM9000 obtains the desired state of an application\
            \ from a dump of the Cloud Controller database.\n- Reconcile the actual\
            \ state of applications with their expected state. For instance, if fewer\
            \ than expected instances are running, HM9000 will instruct the Cloud\
            \ Controller to start the appropriate number of instances.\n- Direct Cloud\
            \ Controller to take action to correct any discrepancies in the state\
            \ of applications.\n"
