# Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) | Network Access to Privileged Accounts
## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
- Although the EC2 instances do not natively have a MFA mechanism, to gain access a privileged user would need to first log into the AWS Management console and provide the authentication code from their AWS MFA device.

## AWS Multi-Factor Authentication
- 18F uses AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security for login access to the AWS management console. With MFA enabled, all 18F users are prompted for a username and password, as well as the authentication code from their AWS MFA device.
- This service has been configured for 18F administrative accounts in AWS IAM.
