Ensure that the jumpbox is secure, along with the load balancer and NAT VM. 5. Encrypt stored files and data within databases to meet data security requirements. Deploy using industry standard encryption and the best practices for your language or framework. 6. Prohibit promiscuous network interfaces on the trusted network. 7.Review and monitor data sharing and security practices with third-party services that you use to provide additional functionality to your application. 8.
