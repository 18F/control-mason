        - 18F has implemented AWS CloudWatch  for basic monitoring of  Amazon EC2 instances. Basic Monitoring for Amazon EC2 instances: Seven pre-selected metrics at five-minute frequency and three status check metrics at one-minute frequency.
        - 18F has implemented Detailed Monitoring for Amazon EC2 instances: All metrics available to Basic Monitoring at one-minute frequency. Instances with Detailed Monitoring enabled allows data aggregation by Amazon EC2 AMI ID and instance type.
        - 18F has also implemented the use Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing where Amazon CloudWatch provides Amazon EC2 instance metrics aggregated by Auto Scaling group and by Elastic Load Balancers.
        - Monitoring data is retained for two weeks, even if AWS resources have been terminated. This enables 18F to quickly look back at the metrics preceding an event of interest.
        - Basic Monitoring is already enabled automatically for all Amazon EC2 instances, and these metrics are accessed in either the Amazon EC2 tab or the Amazon CloudWatch tab of the AWS Management Console, or by using the Amazon CloudWatch API.
    - section: h
      name: Operating System Account (EC2) Management
      elements:

    - section: j
      name: Operating System (EC2) Account Management
      elements:
        - User accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity.
        - Linux accounts will be monitored via scripts which query the last logon date/time of each user account and provide the results in the form of a CSV file which an authorized administrator will use for the basis of disablement.
        - Appliance accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity; this will be a manual review process, but the disablement will be automatic.

  parts:
    - section: a
      name: Operating System (EC2) (EBS) (VPC) Auditable Events
      elements:
      - 18F has implemented AWS CloudTrail for monitoring Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC  that captures API calls and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, all CloudTrail log files are encrypted by using Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE)
      - When CloudTrail logging is enabled, API calls made to Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC actions are tracked in log files, along with any other AWS service records. CloudTrail determines when to create and write to a new file based on a specified time period and file size.
      - Every log entry contains information about who generated the request. The user identity information in the log helps you determine whether the request was made with root or IAM user credentials, with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user, or by another AWS service.
      - CloudTrail publish Amazon SNS notifications when new log files are delivered for 18F staff to review upon log file delivery.
      - 18F implements AlienVault USM for AWS to correlate all AWS audit logs for analysis and review.
