      elements:
        - Within the CF PaaS, Cloud Foundry uses security groups to act as firewalls to control outbound applications in the deployment. 18F uses Cloud Foundry ASGs to specify egress access rules for its applications. This functionality enables 18F to securely restrict application outbound traffic to predefined routes.
        - Cloud Foundry evaluates security groups and other network traffic rules in a strict priority order. Cloud Foundry returns an allow, deny, or reject result for the first rule that matches the outbound traffic request parameters, and does not evaluate any lower-priority rules.
        - Cloud Foundry implements network traffic rules using Linux iptables on the component VMs. Operators can configure rules to prevent system access from external networks and between internal components, and to restrict applications from establishing connections over the DEA network interface.
        - 18F has created a specific set of VPCs ( Live production,  staging  and Lab) for its Cloud Foundry implementation.  All VPCs have subnets used to separate and control IP address  space within each individual VPC.  Subnets must be created in order to launch Availability Zone (AZ) specific services within a VPC. 18F has setup VPC Peering between the Staging VPC and the CF Live production VPC.

        - "Currently, there are six feature flags that can be set. They are all enabled by default except user_org_creation. 1. user_org_creation: When enabled, any user can create and organization via the API. 2. private_domain_creation: When enabled, and organization manager can create private domains for that organization. 3. app_bits_upload: When enabled, space developers can upload app bits. 4. app_scaling: When enabled, space developers can perform scaling operations (i.e. change memory, disk or instances). 5. route_creation: When enabled, a space developer can create routes in a space. 6. service_instance_creation: When enabled, a space developer can create service instances in a space."

        - Security Event Logging and Auditing
        - For operators, Cloud Foundry provides an audit trail through the bosh tasks command. This command shows all actions that and operator has taken with the platform. Additionally, operators can redirect Cloud Foundry component logs to a standard syslog server using the syslog_daemon_config property in the metron_agent job of cf-release.
        - For users, Cloud Foundry records an audit trail of all relevant API invocations of and app. The CLI command cf events returns this information.
        - Loggregator/doppler, the Cloud Foundry component responsible for logging, provides a stream of log output from hosted applications and from Cloud Foundry system components that interact with applications during updates and execution.

        - Loggregator, the Cloud Foundry component responsible for logging, provides a stream of log output from 18F applications and from Cloud Foundry system components that interact with your app during updates and execution.
        - By default, Loggregator streams logs to a terminal. 18F will drain logs to a third-party log management service such as AlienVault USM and AWS Cloudtrail.
        - Cloud Foundry gathers and stores logs in a best-effort manner. If a client is unable to consume log lines quickly enough, the Loggregator buffer may need to overwrite some lines before the client has consumed them. a syslog drain or a CLI tail can usually keep up with the flow of application logs.

      elements:
        - 18F utilizes the Cloud Foundry Secure Deployment best practices which include the following: 1. Configure UAA clients and users using a standard BOSH manifest for cloud Foundry Deployment. Limit and manage these clients and users as you would any other kind of privileged account. 2. Deploy within a VPC that limits network traffic to individual VMs. This reduce the possibility of unauthorized access to the VMs within your BOSH-managed cloud. 3. Enable HTTPS for applications and SSL database connections to protect sensitive data transmitted to and from applications. 4. Ensure that the jumpbox is secure, along with the load balancer and NAT VM. 5. Encrypt stored files and data within databases to meet data security requirements. Deploy using industry standard encryption and the best practices for your language or framework. 6. Prohibit promiscuous network interfaces on the trusted network. 7.Review and monitor data sharing and security practices with third-party services that you use to provide additional functionality to your application. 8. Store SSH keys securely to prevent disclosure, and promptly replace lost or compromised keys. 9. Use Cloud Foundry’s RBAC model to restrict users access to only what is necessary to complete their tasks. 10. Use a strong passphrase for both Cloud Foundry user account and SSH keys.
